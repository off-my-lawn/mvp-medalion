# mvp-medalion
Just something I made for my roller derby team to award to their opponents

I'd love to see how you use it.

medal.scad:
- OpenSCAD project to build both the front and back of the medalion.

base.blend:
- Blender file to import the model OpenSCAD gives you to combine with the skate (OpenSCAD ends up with a corrupt model if done in there)

DerbySkate_L_repaired_Cut_2.stl:

- The skate that appears on the front

- Not sure where this came from

sws.svg & tgss.svg:
- My interpretations of the logos of the two competitions I've used this for

Printing notes:
- I turned on the experimental option make overhangs printable. Without this, the wheels of the skate were too fragile for my liking
- A colour change at the top of the base medalion and the top of the background for each side looks really nice
